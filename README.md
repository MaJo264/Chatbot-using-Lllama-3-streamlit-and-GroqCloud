## 🛠️ Clone the Repository

First, you need to clone this repository to your local machine. Open your terminal and run:

## 🔑 Create a GroqCloud API Key

To run this project, you'll need an API key from GroqCloud. Follow these steps to generate your own API key:

1. Visit the [GroqCloud website](https://groq.com/cloud).
2. Sign up or log in to your account.
3. Navigate to the API section and generate a new API key.

Once you have your API key, create a file named `.env` in the `src/` directory and add the following:

```json
{
  "GROQ_API_KEY": "your_groq_api_key"
}
```

Make sure to replace `"your_groq_api_key"` with your actual API key.

## 🚀 Running the Project

Once everything is set up, you can run the Streamlit application with the following command in your terminal:

```bash
streamlit run src/main.py
```

This will start a local server and open the chatbot in your default web browser. You should see an interactive chatbot powered by LLaMa 3.
